Can no choice be the right choice?

Theo Argyle can’t believe he bought a woman—but there was no other way to rescue her. The wedding he coerced Jessalyn into should have been their first date. Marrying her was supposed to protect her, but Theo soon learns that the woman he’s falling for still isn’t safe from the forces that want her.

Can he continue to keep Jessalyn safe, and convince her that they belong together even after the danger is past?
