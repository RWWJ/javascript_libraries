          Written on January 8, 1986 shortly after my arrest...

          "  I am a hacker, enter my world...
          Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
          the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me..."
          ...
          "  I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
          for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
          Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head... ""
          ...
          "  I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
          cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
          screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                  Or feels threatened by me...
                  Or thinks I'm a smart ass..."
          ...
          "  I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto."
